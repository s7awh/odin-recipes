        <h2>What is Omelette</h2>
        <p>An omelette is a dish made from eggs, fried with butter or oil in a frying pan. It is a common practice for an omelette to include fillings such as chives, vegetables, mushrooms, meat (often ham or bacon), cheese, onions or some combination of the above.</p>
    
        <h3>Ingridients for basic Omelette</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp (15 mL) water</li>
        <li>Pinch salt</li>
        <li>Pinch pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp (15 mL) butter or oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs, water, salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in an 8-inch (20 cm) nonstick frying pan over medium heat. Pour in egg mixture. As eggs set around edge of pan, with spatula, gently push cooked portions toward centre of skillet. Tilt and rotate skillet to allow uncooked egg to flow into empty spaces.</li>
        <li>When eggs are almost set on surface but still look moist, cover half of omelette with filling. Slip spatula under unfilled side; fold over onto filled half.</li>
        <li>Cook for a minute, then slide omelette onto plate.</li>
    </ol>
